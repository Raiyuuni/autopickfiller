# AutoPickFiller
**TL;DR:** An Inkscape extension for automatically filling closed paths with colors picked from a layer underneath.

## Full Description
AutoPickFiller is a tool that makes creating low poly art a little easier.

When a reference layer is used to set the paths' fill colors, picking and setting each color manually is a [highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcxuwDKo6I) [repetitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdqndZ6T3MA) and error-prone task.

AutoPickFiller makes this process automatic by exporting the reference layer as an image and picking its colors using Python's pillow library.

## Installation
Download both .inx and .py files and move them to Inkscape's user extensions directory.

In Inkscape 1.3, it can be located at: `Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions`.

Restart Inkscape to make the new extension available.
