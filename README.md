# AutoPickFiller
<p>**TL;DR:** An Inkscape extension for automatically filling closed paths with colors picked from a layer underneath.</p>

## Full Description
<p>AutoPickFiller is a tool that makes creating low poly art a little easier.</p>
<p>When a reference layer is used to set the paths' fill colors, picking and setting each color manually is a [highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcxuwDKo6I) [repetitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdqndZ6T3MA) and error-prone task.</p>
<p>AutoPickFiller makes this process automatic by exporting the reference layer as an image and picking its colors using Python's pillow library.</p>
